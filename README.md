### What it is

LearnVenture is a versatile tool you can use to build engaging educational quests. With a simple, straight forward design it is easy to use for both 'teachers' and 'students.'
Anyone can use this site to help teach any topic. Educators can put students in the shoes of influential characters from history to test their knowledge of current curriculum.
In the professional landscape, employers can use it to create informational material on how to use new products and services. If you have knowledge to impart, LearnVenture is a
fun tool to help share that information.
